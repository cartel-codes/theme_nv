## 🛠️ BRANCHING STRATEGY (PARALLEL WORKFLOW)
To work on multiple features effectively, we follow this Git workflow:

### 1. The `main` Branch
- **Purpose**: Stable, production-ready code.
- **Rule**: Never commit broken code to `main`.

### 2. Feature Branches (`feat/name`)
- **Action**: Create a new branch for every new feature or fix.
- **Example**: `git checkout -b feat/checkout-fix`
- **Benefits**: Allows working on `feat/seo-tips` and `feat/cart-fix` simultaneously without interference.

### 3. Keeping in Sync
- **Hub Updates**: When a feature is merged, update `PROJECT_HUB.md` on `main`.
- **Merging**: Regularly pull `main` into your feature branch to stay up-to-date.
