## 1. Project Overview

Novraux is a fashion/clothing brand being built from the ground up with a focus on **SEO-first strategy**, **100% free and open-source tooling**, and a **dark luxury editorial aesthetic** (YSL / Hermès inspired). The goal is to build a fully functional, SEO-optimized e-commerce store and custom WordPress theme — without spending money on themes, plugins, or hosting during the build phase.
